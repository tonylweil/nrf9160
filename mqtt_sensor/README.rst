Attempting to combine dht22 and mqtt_simple to send temp and humidity info from nrf9160-feather to mqtt server. So far this just successfully connects to the MQTT server. Gets the temp and humidity info from the DHT22 and prints it to the serial port.

I'm not sure how to convert the numeric info to a character string and then publish it to the MQTT server.
